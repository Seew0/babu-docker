# Virtual machines 
  
  It is a compute resource that uses software instead of physical hardware 

 
  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC. 
  
# Containers
 
 They are OS level machines treated as processes by the host machine multiple can exist on the host machine for a set amount of time with minimal resource and parallely more effecient than VMs
